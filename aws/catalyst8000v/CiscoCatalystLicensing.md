# Cisco Catalyst 8000V Edge for SD-WAN Licensing on AWS


During the Deployment of the [Cisco Catalyst 8000V setup on AWS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/C8000V/AWS/deploying-c8000v-on-amazon-web-services/overview.html) you have to choose one of 4 deployment options from the AWS Marketplace:

1. Cisco Catalyst 8000V - Advantage PAYG
   Pay as you Go.  You pay for the software through AWS
2. Cisco Catalyst 8000V - Essentials PAYG
   Pay as you Go.  You pay for the software through AWS
3. Cisco Catalyst 8000V - BYOL
   This is where you buy a license from Cisco and bring it to AWS
4. Cisco Catalyst 8000V - BYOL For SDWAN
   This is the software we already use and the one we want to use on AWS


We will use Option 4, Cisco Catalyst 8000V - BYOL For SDWAN.  We will bring our own license that we get through the existing Cisco contract.
