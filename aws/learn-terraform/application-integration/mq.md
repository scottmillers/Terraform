# AWS MQ

-  AWS offering for a managed message broker service for Apache ActiveMQ. Message brokers allow different software systems–often using different programming languages, and on different platforms–to communicate and exchange information.
- Amazon MQ also supports RabbitMQ, a popular open-source message broker. Migrate your existing RabbitMQ message brokers to AWS without having to rewrite code.

## Features

- Amazon MQ uses industry-standard APIs and protocols for messaging, including Java Message Service (JMS), .NET Message Service (NMS), AMQP, STOMP, MQTT, OpenWire, and WebSocket.

- Amazon MQ manages administrative tasks such as hardware provisioning, broker setup, software upgrades, and failure detection and recovery.

- Amazon MQ stores your messages redundantly across multiple Availability Zones (AZs)

- Amazon MQ supports both single-instance brokers, suitable for evaluation and testing, and active/standby brokers for high availability in production. In the event of a failure of the broker, or even a full AZ outage, Amazon MQ automatically fails over to the standby broker.
