# AWS Budgets

- Set custom budgets that alert you when your costs or usage exceed or are forecasted to exceed your budgeted amount.
- With Budgets, you can view the following information:
    - How close your plan is to your budgeted amount or to the free tier limits
    - Your usage to date, including how much you have used of your Reserved Instances and purchased Savings Plans.
    - Your current estimated charges from AWS and how much your predicted usage will incur in charges by the end of the month
    - How much of your budget has been used
