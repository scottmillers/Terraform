# AWS Cost Allocation Tags

- Tags are labels you can apply to your AWS resources
- Apply tags to AWS resources to categorize them by purpose, owner, or other criteria
- Then active the tags in the Billing and Cost Management console, and you can track the costs associated with those resources

Use Case would be to put a tag on a S3 bucket and then track the costs associated with that bucket in Cost Explorer
