# AWS Savings Plans

- Savings Plan is a flexible pricing model that helps you save up cost on Amazon EC2, AWS Fargate, and AWS Lambda usage.
- You can purchase Savings Plans from any account, payer or linked. 
- By default, the benefit provided by Savings Plans is applicable to usage across all accounts within an AWS Organization/consolidated billing family. You can also choose to restrict the benefit of Savings Plans to only the account that purchased them.
- Similar to Reserved Instances, you have All Upfront, Partial upfront, or No upfront payment options.
