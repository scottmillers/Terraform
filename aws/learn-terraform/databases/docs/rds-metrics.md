# RDS Metrics


- Amazon RDS provides metrics in real-time for the operating system (OS) that your DB instance runs on.
- You can view these metrics using the console, or consume them as raw data in CloudWatch Logs and CloudWatch Events.
- By default, Enhanced Monitoring metrics are stored in the CloudWatch Logs of your DB instance for 30 days
- Enhanced monitoring gathers its metrics from an agent on the instance, wheras cloud watch gathers it metrics from the hypervisor
- Enhanced monitoring is more detailed than cloud watch
