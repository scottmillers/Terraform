# RDS Monitoring

- Amazon Cloudwatch
- RDS Events
    - An Amazon RDS event is created when the reboot is completed
    - Be notified when changes occur with a DB instance, DB snapshot, DB parameter group, DB security group, or DB option group
    - Uses the Amazon SNS service to send notifications when an event occurs
- Database log files
- Use enhanced monitoring to collect metrics in real time for the operating system (OS) that your DB instance runs on
- Enhanced monitoring gathers its metrics from an agent on the instance, whereas CloudWatch gathers its metrics from the hypervisor
