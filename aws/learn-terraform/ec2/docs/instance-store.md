# EC2 Instance Store

- Instance store provides temporary block-level storage for your instance.
- The data on an instance store volume persists only during the life of the associated instance.
- Use RAID 0 (striping) across multiple instance store volumes to increase the I/O performance available to applications running on your instance.
