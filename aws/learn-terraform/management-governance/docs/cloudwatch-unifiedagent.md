# CloudWatch Unified Agent - Metrics
- Collected directly from your Linux server/EC2 instance

- CPU (active, guest, idle, system, user, steal)
- Disk (read/write bytes, read/write ops, read/write time)
- Memory (active, available, buffered, cached, free, inactive, slab)
- Netstat (bytes in/out, packets in/out, errors in/out, drops in/out)
- Processes (blocked, idle, paging, running, sleeping, stopped, zombie)
- Swap Space (used, free, page in/out)

- Reminder: out of the box metrics for EC2 - disk, CPU, network all at a high level
