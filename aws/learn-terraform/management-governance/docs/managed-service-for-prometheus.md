# AWS Managed Service for Prometheus (MSP)

- A managed monitoring service for container environments.

- You can monitor and alert on the performance of containerized workloads using the open-source PromQL without having to scale or manage the underlying infrastructure.

- Automatically scale the ingestion, storage, alerting, and querying of operational metrics as workload increases.

- Integrated with Amazon EKS, Amazon ECS, and AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry.
