# S3 - MFA Delete
- MFA Delete is a feature that uses multi-factor authentication (MFA) to provide an additional layer of security when deleting objects from an S3 bucket.
- MFA Delete can be enabled only when versioning is enabled on the bucket.
- MFA will be required to:
    - Permanently delete an object version
    - Suspend versioning on the bucket
- MFA won't be required to:
    - Enable versioning
    - List deleted versions
    - Access deleted versions
- Only the bucket owner (root account) can enable MFA Delete.
- MFA Delete can be enabled only through the AWS CLI or API, not through the console.
