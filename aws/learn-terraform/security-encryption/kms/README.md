# AWS Key Management Server (KMS)

AWS Key Management Service (KMS) is a managed service that makes it easy for you to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data, and uses Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) to protect the security of your keys.

- To control access to your KMS Customer Managed Keys use KMS Key policies. Every KMS key must have a key policy.  If the key policy allows it you can also use IAM policies to control access to your KMS keys.
