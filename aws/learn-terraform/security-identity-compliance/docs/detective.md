# AWS Detective

- The service automatically collects log data from your AWS resources and uses machine learning, statistical analysis, and graph theory to build a linked set of data that enables you to easily conduct faster and more efficient security investigations. 
- Can be integrated with AWS security services like Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Macie, and AWS Security Hub as well as partner security products to identify potential security issues, or findings.
- Amazon Detective can analyze trillions of events from multiple data sources such as **VPC Flow Logs, AWS CloudTrail, and Amazon GuardDuty**, and automatically creates a unified, interactive view of your resources, users, and the interactions between them over time. This allows you to identify the underlying reasons for the findings, drill down into relevant historical activities, and quickly determine the root cause of a security concern.
- Amazon Detectiveâ€™s prebuilt data aggregations, summaries, and context help you to quickly analyze and determine the nature and extent of possible security issues.
