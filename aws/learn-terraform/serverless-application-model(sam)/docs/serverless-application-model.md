# AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)

- An open-source framework for building serverless applications
- It provides shorthand syntax to express functions, APIs, databases, and event source mappings
- You create a JSON or YAML configuration file to define your serverless applications
- During deployment, SAM transforms and expands the SAM syntax into AWS CloudFormation syntax
- SAM CLI provides a Lambda-like execution environment locally build, test functions, APIs, and other AWS resources locally
- You can use AWS SAM to build serverless applications that use any runtime supported by AWS Lambda. You can also use AWS SAM CLI to locally debug Lambda functions written in Node.js, Python, and Ruby.
