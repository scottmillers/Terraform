# S3 - Requester Pays

- In general, bucket owners pay for all Amazon S3 storage and data transfer costs associated with their bucket

- With Requester Pays buckets, the requester instead of the bucket owner pays the cost of the request and the data download from the bucket

- Helpful when you want to share large datasets with other AWS accounts

- The requester must be authenticated in AWS (cannot be anonymous)
