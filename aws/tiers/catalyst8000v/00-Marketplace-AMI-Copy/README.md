# Terraform to build the AWS environment for VM Import/Export

This repository contains the scripts to copy a AMI that was created on my personal AWS account, with Marketplace access, to my work AWS account, which does not have Marketplace access.  

This effort failed.  Any AMI created from a Marketplace AMI is not allowed to be shared to any account without Marketplace access.  This is a restriction from AWS.
