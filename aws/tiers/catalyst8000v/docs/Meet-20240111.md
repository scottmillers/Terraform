# POC Team Meeting-2021-01-11


Agenda:
- Goal is to prepare for the handover so configuration can start
- How- Go over the design document

Networking
- Do the ports look correct?
- Where does IPSec used?
- I can only add 3 NIC cards to a EC2 instance.  What are the requirements for the connection from the Controller to the WebServer?  Is the two NIC cards to increase bandwidth?
- Do you have any bandwidth requirements for the connections?

EC2 Instances
- Do you need the extra 2TB drive mounted on the EC2 instance or should I keep it as a device for the Cisco Catalyst 8000V SD-WAN software to mount?
- If I mount it as a device for the Cisco Catalyst 8000V SD-WAN software to mount, what is the mount point?

Handover:
- Access to the Sandbox account
- Access to the 3 EC2 instances using the key pair.  I will send you the Private key in email.
